'''Write a program to read a string containing numbers separated by a space and convert it as a list of integers. 
Perform the following operations on it.
3.Rotate elements in a list by 'k' position to the right
4.Convert the list into a tuple using list comprehension
5.Remove all duplicates from the tuple and convert them into a list again.
6.Create another list by putting the results of the evaluation of the function f(x) = (x^2) â€“ x with each element in the final list

5.After sorting them individually, merge the two lists to create a single sorted list.
